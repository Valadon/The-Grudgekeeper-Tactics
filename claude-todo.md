**Notes:**
- Each checkbox represents a discrete, testable task
- Tasks are ordered roughly by dependency (earlier phases needed for later ones)
- Some tasks within phases can be done in parallel
- Test thoroughly after each phase before moving to the next
- Keep the existing working game functional during development
