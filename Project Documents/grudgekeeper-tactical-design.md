- Ranger: Stride (3 tiles) + Overwatch cone

**Turn 1 - Enemies**

- Void Hound rushes toward isolated Ranger
- Mining Drone charges beam

**Ship Commentary**: "Oh look, the miner actually hit something. Mark your calendars."

---

## Map Objectives (Pick One Per Encounter)

1. **Extermination**: Eliminate all hostiles (basic)
2. **Defend the Drill**: Protect objective for 8 turns
3. **Resource Extraction**: Reach and hold 3 mineral nodes
4. **Breach and Clear**: Get one dwarf to exit point
5. **Boss Takedown**: Defeat elite enemy + minions

---

## UI Requirements

### Action Display
- Show remaining actions as filled/empty diamonds (‚óÜ‚óÜ‚óá)
- Highlight valid move tiles when action selected
- Show action cost on ability buttons
- Turn order display on side

### Combat Feedback
- Floating damage numbers (big and chunky)
- Hit/miss indicators
- Status effect icons
- Cover indicators on tiles

### Ship Mood Integration
- Portrait shows current mood
- Comments appear in speech bubble
- Mood affects available ship abilities

---

## Progression Hooks (For Full Game)

After each combat:
- **Salvage**: Collect scrap from battlefield
- **Grudge Points**: Based on performance
- **Ship Approval**: Affects next encounter difficulty
- **Unlock Tokens**: For new abilities/equipment

---

## Key Design Principles

1. **Every Action Matters**: 3 actions means 3 meaningful choices
2. **Positioning > Damage**: Good positioning should trump raw DPS
3. **No Perfect Strategies**: Multiple valid approaches to each encounter
4. **Quick Resolution**: If it takes >10 minutes, it's too long
5. **Personality Throughout**: Ship comments on tactics, mocks failures

---

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: "Cargo Bay Ambush"
- 4 Goblin Scavengers, 1 Void Hound
- Crates provide cover throughout
- Objective: Eliminate all enemies
- Ship Mood: Grumpy ("Try not to bleed on my cargo")

### Scenario 2: "Mining Platform Defense"
- 2 Goblins, 1 Mining Drone, waves of 2 more goblins
- Central elevated platform
- Objective: Hold platform for 8 turns
- Ship Mood: Skeptical ("This seems like a terrible idea")

### Scenario 3: "Breach the Vault"
- 1 Elite Goblin Captain, 3 Scavengers
- Multiple rooms with doors
- Objective: Reach vault in 10 turns
- Ship Mood: Excited ("Finally, something worth stealing!")

---

## Implementation Priority

1. **Core Loop**: Movement + basic attacks
2. **Cover System**: Critical for tactical play
3. **3-Action UI**: Must be crystal clear
4. **Two Classes**: Voidguard + Ranger (tank + DPS)
5. **One Enemy Type**: Goblin Scavenger
6. **One Map**: 8x8 with some cover

Get this working first, then layer in complexity!

---

## Balance Notes

- **Hit Chance**: Base 75%, modified by cover/abilities
- **Damage**: Should down fodder in 2 hits, tanks in 4-5
- **Healing**: Limited - maybe 2-3 heals per combat max
- **Movement**: Should cross map in 3 turns if unobstructed
- **Ammo**: Some weapons need reload for tactical pressure

Remember: We're not making XCOM. We're making "Grumpy Space Dwarves Shoot Things While Their Ship Insults Them."
