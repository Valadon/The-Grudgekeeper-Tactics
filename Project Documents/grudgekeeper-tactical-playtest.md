# The Grudgekeeper - Tactical Combat Playtest Rules v0.1

## Setup
- 8x8 grid (chess board works great!)
- Need: d20, d6s, tokens for characters
- Dwarves start within 2 squares of entry door
- Enemies start at marked positions

## Core Mechanics

### Each Turn: 3 Actions
- **Move** (1 action): Move up to Speed squares
- **Strike** (1 action): Make an attack
- **Aim** (1 action): +2 to next Strike this turn
- **Interact** (1 action): Open door, grab objective
- **Reload** (1 action): Required for some weapons
- **Defend** (1 action): +2 AC until your next turn

### Basic d20 System
- **Attack Roll**: d20 + Attack Bonus vs target's AC
- **Damage**: Weapon damage (no roll)
- **Critical Hit** (20 or 10+ over AC): Double damage
- **Critical Fail** (1 or 10+ under AC): Bad stuff (drop weapon, jam, etc.)

### Movement Rules
- **Diagonal**: Costs 1 square (keeping it simple)
- **Difficult Terrain**: Costs 2 movement per square
- **Adjacent Enemies**: Can move away freely (no AoO for simplicity)

### Shooting Rules
- **Line of Sight**: Draw straight line, no corners
- **Cover**: 
  - Half Cover (-2 to hit): Low walls, barrels
  - Full Cover (-4 to hit): Can barely see target
- **Range**: No penalty within weapon range, can't shoot beyond

## Playtest Questions
After each combat, consider:

1. **Fun Factor**: Did tactical decisions feel meaningful?
2. **Duration**: How many rounds? (Target: 5-8)
3. **Difficulty**: Too easy/hard? 
4. **Actions**: Is 3 actions right? Do some feel useless?
5. **Movement**: Does positioning matter enough?
6. **Abilities**: Are they worth using over basic attacks?
7. **Pacing**: Any boring/slow moments?
